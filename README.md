# Decision Tree & Random Forest Classifier - Heart Disease Prediction

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship - Task 5.  
We use tree-based models (Decision Tree and Random Forest) to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical data.

---

## Objective

- Train and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier.
- Visualize the decision tree.
- Control overfitting using `max_depth`.
- Train a Random Forest classifier.
- Compare accuracy between the two.
- Analyze feature importance.
- Evaluate models using cross-validation.
